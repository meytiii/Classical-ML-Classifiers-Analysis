Suggested Structure for the Notebooks:
1. Notebook for MNIST (High-Dimensional Data):

Dataset Loading: Load the MNIST dataset from ARFF or CSV.

Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values, split data into training and testing sets.

Modeling: Train and evaluate models like Logistic Regression, SVM, kNN, etc.

Visualization: Visualize a few digits (images) from the MNIST dataset.

2. Notebook for Diabetes Dataset (Low-Dimensional Data with Noise):

Dataset Loading: Load and clean the diabetes dataset from the files.

Preprocessing: Normalize the Glucose and Insulin levels, handle missing values.

Modeling: Train and evaluate models like Linear Regression, kNN, etc.

Evaluation: Evaluate accuracy or other relevant metrics.

3. Notebook for Moons and Circles (Non-Linear Decision Boundary Data):

Dataset Generation: Use make_moons and make_circles to generate synthetic datasets.

Preprocessing: Scale the features using StandardScaler.

Modeling: Train and evaluate models like SVM, kNN, Decision Trees, etc.

Visualization: Plot decision boundaries to show the performance of different models.
